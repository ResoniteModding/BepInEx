# This is a bootstrapper to run Resonite in what is quite the unorthodox
# configuration on Linux.
#
# This script is executed by the "ResoBoot" bootstrapper if ResoBoot
# detects it's running under Proton/Wine.
#
# The following shell code is responsible for installing an adequate runtime
# for Resonite that's independent from any system installation (or lack thereof)
# and for ensuring that Renderite is executed with Proton's Wine installation
# and not the system's.


### SCRIPT START ###

# Ensure that $DOTNET_ROOT points to the downloaded runtime rather
# than at the system's. Also ensure that the root and tools subfolder
# are temporarily added to the system's $PATH variable just to make
# sure things work correctly.

# 	# This script tries to exec a terminal emulator by trying some known terminal
# 	# emulators.
# 	#
# 	# We welcome patches that add distribution-specific mechanisms to find the
# 	# preferred terminal emulator. On Debian, there is the x-terminal-emulator
# 	# symlink for example.
# 	#
# 	# Invariants:
# 	# 1. $TERMINAL comes first.
# 	# 2. The most common terminal emulators from popular desktop environments are tried afterwards.
# 	# 4. More niche/less well-known terminal emulators are tried next.
# 	# 3. Distribution-specific mechanisms come last (since they're kind of clunky), e.g. x-terminal-emulator, uxterm, xterm, etc.
