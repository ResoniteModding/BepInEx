# BepisLoader
[![Thunderstore Badge](https://modding.resonite.net/assets/available-on-thunderstore.svg)](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/)

A mod loader which allows using BepInEx with [Resonite](https://resonite.com/).

## Installation (Manual)

1. Download the latest release ZIP file (e.g., `ResoniteModding-BepisLoader-1.4.1.zip`) from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/p/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader/).
2. Extract the contents of the `BepInExPack` folder from the ZIP into your Resonite installation directory:
   - **Windows Default:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\`
   - **Linux Default:** `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Resonite/`
3. **Linux Users Only:** The included `LinuxBootstrap.sh` file needs to be used instead of the default one:
   - The package includes a modified `LinuxBootstrap.sh` that launches `BepisLoader.dll` instead of `Renderite.Host.dll`
   - Currently, the script might not be executable when you first setup the plugin.
     If that is the case, you need to run `chmod +x LinuxBootstrap.sh` in your Resonite profile folder in order to fix this manually.
   - **Important:** Resonite updates could replace this file, breaking the mod loader. If this happens, you'll need to manually replace `LinuxBootstrap.sh` with the one from the BepisLoader package.
     - Some mod managers - including Gale - will copy the script from their managed profile folder to the Resonite install directory on every game launch. In which case, you do not need to replace it manually.
4. Enable the modded entry point by replacing `enable=false` with `enable=true` in the file `hookfxr.ini`
   - Alternatively, add `--hookfxr-enable` to your launch arguments. 
5. Start the game normally.
6. If you want to verify that the mod loader is working, check the `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` file after launching the game.

### Disabling temporarily
1. Set `enable=false` in the file `hookfxr.ini`
   - Alternatively, add `--hookfxr-disable` to your launch arguments.
2. If you had added `--hookfxr-enable` to your launch arguments before, you must remove it. 

### Uninstallation

1. Delete the following files from your Resonite installation directory:
   - **Windows Entry Points:**
     - `hostfxr.dll` (our Windows entry point)
     - `hostfxr.pdb`
   - **Common Files:**
     - `hookfxr.ini`
     - All `BepisLoader*` files
2. Delete the `BepInEx` folder.

## Package Contents

The BepisLoader package contains:
- **Windows Entry Point:** `hostfxr.dll` and `hookfxr.ini` for hooking into the .NET runtime
- **Linux Entry Point:** Modified `LinuxBootstrap.sh` that launches BepisLoader if hookfxr is enabled (in `hookfxr.ini` or with launch options)
- **BepisLoader:** Core loader files (`BepisLoader.dll`, etc.)
- **BepInEx:** The BepInEx framework and all required dependencies
